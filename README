This is a plugin to use id-utils (http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/) gid command for quickly finding in files. This plugin searches for a given word and lists the results in a small window. As you move over the results, each file is shown in the preview window. 

Now on Github: https://github.com/milkbikis/IDSearch.vim

To edit the previewed file in the same window, press Enter (<CR>). To go back to the original file, press H.
To open it in a new tab, press t.
To open silently in a new tab, press T.

Note:
This is my first attempt at writing a vim script. I used NERDTree's source to learn how to do certain things. It's a fantastic plugin for file exploration and more.
